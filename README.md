# Unreal-Engine-Capstone
In this project I present the game that I made as Capstone Project for the C++ and Unreale Engine Course from [The Tech Academy](https://www.learncodinganywhere.com/) Game Developer Boot Camp.
The Project was setup to stimulate a real job project as much as possible. Therefor I was given tasks in the form of user storys.
